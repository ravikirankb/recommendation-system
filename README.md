# Recommendation System

This is my yet another attempt to learn and implenent different machine learning algorithms. This time I want to attempt to learn and develop a recommendation system which does product recommendation to users using the Amazon product reviews dataset.


The objective of this project is to learn the theory and implementaion of algorithms behind designing a product recommendation system in a simple and easy to understand manner. 

**Disclaimer:** I am not a machine learning engineer or a Data scientist. This is also a self learning project where I learn from other study materials, blogs and articles from the internet. I try to break down things to its simplest form and provide a step by step implementation and explanation for easy of understanding and quickly understand some of the concepts behind the algorithms and try to put everything together in one place.
