# Recommendation System

This is my yet another attempt to learn and implenent different machine learning algorithms. This time I want to attempt to learn and develop a recommendation system which does product recommendation to users using the Amazon product reviews dataset.


The objective of this project is to learn the theory and implementaion of algorithms behind designing a product recommendation system in a simple and easy to understand manner. 

In this project I explain the fundamental principles and theories of recommendation systems. Runs through the code for various stages of developing such a system. Explain the logic and different techniques that can be applied across other areas of development.

Majority of the learnings from the blog article by [umaraju18](https://github.com/umaraju18) 
(https://medium.com/towards-data-science/sentiment-analysis-and-product-recommendation-on-amazons-electronics-dataset-reviews-part-1-6b340de660c2)
and other blogs and articles from other online sources.



>**Disclaimer:** 

I am not a machine learning engineer or a Data scientist. This is also a self learning project where I learn from other study materials, blogs and articles from the internet. I try to break down things to its simplest form and provide a step by step implementation and explanation for ease of understanding and quickly understand some of the concepts behind the algorithms and try to put everything together in one place.
